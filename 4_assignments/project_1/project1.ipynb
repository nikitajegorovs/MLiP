You are strongly encouraged to explore many different modeling methods (e.g. linear regression, interaction terms, lasso, etc.) but you should not include a detailed narrative of all of these attempts.

This section should then detail is the development of the linear regression model in terms of features used, interactions considered, and any additional tuning and validation which ultimately led to your final model.* \n",
